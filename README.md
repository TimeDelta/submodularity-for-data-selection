This is some old corpus augmentation code I wrote around 2014. The main algorithm is in [Filter.cpp](scripts/Filter.cpp), which is based on the paper [Submodularity for Data Selection in Statistical Machine Translation](https://aclanthology.org/D14-1014.pdf). There are also some supporting scripts for data prep, transforming the output to a WFST ([arpa2fst](scripts/arpa2fst)), the main mining script ([mine_google.py](scripts/mine_google.py)), etc.
